Project intended to learn the inner workings of compilers and how they operate.

Goal is to write a compiler for the LOX Language. Details for this can be found at:
https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html#top 

Currently have:
    The lexical anaylzer (thanks to flex)

Wokring on now:
    The parser

All of this is planned to be implemented in C (because to heck with C++)
